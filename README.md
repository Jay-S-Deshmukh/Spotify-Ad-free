### Project Overview 

This filter list was created 2015 and is under MIT license by CHEF-KOCH and contains all the advertising domains which are hard-coded within Spotify (free account). <br/>

The project is unofficial and not in any relationship with [Spotify AB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify). An unofficial [FAQ can be found here](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/Spotify-Ad-free/blob/master/Spotify%20FAQ.md), read it - it's worth it!. <br/> 

~~# Project is closed and merged within [CK's-FilterList](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/CKs-FilterList) ([mirror](https://gitlab.com/CHEF-KOCH/cks-filterlist))!~~

### Spotify app privacy

You can easily import the "blocker" (filters) list into any Ad-blocker or download the pre-made Ad-Free versions. A HOSTS file is not a "crack". 

An additional advice is to set the following parameters within the Spotify app:

- Edit - Preferences (CTRL + P) - Privacy _Block all cookies..._ (enable it)
- Edit - Preferences (CTRL + P) - Advertisement - Change advertising preferences (disable everything here on the Spotify website)
- Manually delete the Spotify cache folder and mark it as _read-only_so that Spotify won't get access tp it, which prevents to store meta-data and ads in it. 

This helps to get rid of cookie leftover(s) tracker(s) and reduces the chance to see banner ads (it does not remove them!). 


### Release & RePack information

I do _not officially maintain this project_ which means every work I still do is for the community only and entirely for free. I spent a lot of time debugging and inspecting Spotify's traffic. 

No one is forced to download something from the [release tab](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/Spotify-Ad-free/releases) nor do I support something illegal here. Repacking the installer is not illegal, however modifying the files itself is because it's against ToS (which I respect) but including several additional patches and a HOSTS file seems pretty much okay because Spotify does include already anti-blocking debugging techniques to prevent all of this. Abusing "holes" is illegal. 

In this repo I provide:
* Ad-Free mods for Desktops and the Android OS. MacOS is official not supported because I don't use any Apple products.
* Filter lists in order to block ads (via hosts).
