# Contributing to Spotify-Ad-free
I love your input! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and as transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code or project
- Submitting a fix or change
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/Spotify-Ad-free/issues) ticket system
I use GitHub issues ticket system to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and _sample code_

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Do not open or bypass the issue ticket system
Bypassing the issue ticket system will result in a perma ban. Do not abuse my public channels (Discord, Matrix, Telegram,...) to bypass the ticket system.

## DO NOT POST "I still get ads"
This will also result in a perm ban. If you have nothing useful to offer, than just do not open an issue ticket. 

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.
